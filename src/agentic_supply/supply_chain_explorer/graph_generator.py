    CodedTool implementation of a calculator for the math_guy test.

        Called when the coded tool is invoked asynchronously by the agent hierarchy.
        Strongly consider overriding this method instead of the "easier" synchronous
        version above when the possibility of making any kind of call that could block
        (like sleep() or a socket read/write out to a web service) is within the

                for which coded_tool publishes new entries is well understood

                adding the data is not invoke()-ed more than once.
